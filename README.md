# Data Cleaning & Storytelling with Pandas & Matplotlib
 Data Analysis - whether it’s beneficial to discount products or not
 
**Project objectives & overview**
    
    The company (Eniac — the e-commerce tech company) has high hopes put into the possibilities that come with Data Analysis, and they are especially hopeful that your work can finally settle an ongoing debate: **whether it’s beneficial to discount products or not**.
    
    - The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
    - The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.
    
    Your analytical and business skills are needed to provide clarity in the following aspects:
    
    - How products should be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis.
    - What is the distribution of product prices across different categories.
    - How many products are being discounted.
    - How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices.
    - How seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales.
    - How could data collection be improved.
    
    Y**ou are expected to give a presentation** to the company board and present the results of your analysis. The presentation needs to be concise, but also engaging and convincing.
    
    Before you get too deep into the business questions, there is some bad news we need to share with you: **the data appears to have some inconsistencies —it must have been corrupted**. In short, you will have a lot of **data cleaning** to do before you can even start to think about the business questions.
