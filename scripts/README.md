In the notebook '2_data_cleaning_with_pandas_challenges.ipynb' I didn't like the
school approach in the '4.1.2 unit_price' section, where they: 
- dropped 12.3% of the rows in our DataFrame
- delete an entire column

I made some modification in the '2_data_cleaning_with_pandas_challenges.ipynb' in the '4.1.2 unit_price' section
I decide to keep that column (I have done that in another notebook named 
'2.1_data_cleaning_with_pandas_Rubens_touch.ipynb')
