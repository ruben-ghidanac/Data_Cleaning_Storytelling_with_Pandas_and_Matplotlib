In the notebook '2_data_cleaning_with_pandas_challenges.ipynb' I didn't like the
school approach in the '4.1.2 unit_price' section, where they: 
- dropped 12.3% of the rows in our DataFrame, because of that I let that notebook in his form, 
with his approach on that section, and I created another notebook named 
- delete a column, which I decide to clean it and keep it
'2.1_data_cleaning_with_pandas_Rubens_touch.ipynb'
